Based on the last result given from looking at the DowJones index
a lot of relations were found between McDonalds and United 
Health Group, however due to PICCOLO having to keep the remainder 
of the stocks also small, it could not maximize the structure for
the Mcdonalds vis-a-vis United Health Group

Thus the goal of this workbook it to see if more structure can be
derived out of both.
