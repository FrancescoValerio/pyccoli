workbook 1
Apple stock data analysis shows that the stock
can actually give information about itself. 
Not only are the low and high tied together
(which makes sense to a degree) but volume is
also filled with patterns. Interestingly
you'd assume the variance between low and high price
to not be this stable in variablility however it 
only needds 4 patterns to describe it for over 66%

workbook 2
Dowjones and exxon mobile

workbook 3
United Health and Mcdonalds (from the dowjones data)

workbook 4
United Health compared with Travellers from the index data

workbook 5
United Health compared with Travellers from their own data

workbook 6
United Health compared with Travellers combining the patterns 
from 5 and 6 to see the difference

workbook 7
is this also the case with United health and Mcdonalds?
that when taken from the dowjones instead of when taken just
together you get different patterns? Yes
