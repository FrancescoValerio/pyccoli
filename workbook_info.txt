workbook 1
Apple stock data analysis shows that the stock
can actually give information about itself. 
Not only are the low and high tied together
(which makes sense to a degree) but volume is

you'd assume the variance between low and high price
to not be this stable in variablility however it 
only needds 4 patterns to describe it for over 66%
