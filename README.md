# PYCCOLI project

This repo contains all code used for the PYCCOLI project (see: https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/395858/Thesis%20(4).pdf?sequence=1)
To recreate the experiment, the workbook_info.txt serves as a reference and every workbook.py reproduces the experimental results.

The output of the experimental results is stored within the output 
folder, the graphs within the graphs folder, the stock data
within the Stocks folder and the index component data within the 
Component_data folder.
